## Local development (for this website)
This project was bootstrapped with Next.js. To run locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the site. The homepage is at app/page.tsx. The project uses `next/font` for font optimization.

## Contributing to this repository
- Read CONTRIBUTING.md (create one if missing) for detailed contribution flow.
- Use issues to propose changes or request features.
- Fork → branch with descriptive name → open a PR referencing the issue.
- Follow the repository's branch naming and commit conventions (e.g., `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`).
- Provide a short description and testing steps in PRs. Maintainers will review and merge.

Suggested minimal PR checklist:
- Code builds and runs locally
- No console errors or warnings
- Add or update documentation when behavior changes
- Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes

## Mentorship & Evaluation
- Mentors should track progress and provide regular feedback.
- Contributors are evaluated on contribution quality, collaboration, and learning progress.
- Keep open communication with mentors and update issue/PR status frequently.
